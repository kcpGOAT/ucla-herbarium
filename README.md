The purpose of this project is to help understand and visualize the distribution of botanical specimen findings across the state of California and neighboring regions. The repository itself
both an EDA of the dataset containing the specimen information and the code used to build the Shiny web application. This web app not only displays the many specimens on a map, but it also enables
users to filter which points are shown based on certain variables.
